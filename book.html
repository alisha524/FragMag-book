						<p class="text"> Ikigai can describe having a sense of purpose in life,as well as being
							motivated.
							According to a study,[vague] feeling ikigai as described in Japanese usually means the
							feeling of
							accomplishment and fulfillment that follows when people pursue their passions. Activities
							that allow one
							to feel ikigai are not forced on an individual; they are perceived as being spontaneous and
							undertaken
							willingly, therefore they are personal and depend on a person's inner self.</p>

						<p class="text">The word consists of 'Iki' ("to live") and 'gai' ("reason").[2] The term
							'ikigai' compounds two
							Japanese words: 'iki' (生き, meaning "life;alive") and 'kai' (甲斐, meaning "(an) effect; (a)
							result; (a)
							fruit;
							(a) worth; (a) use; (a) benefit; (no, little) avail") (sequentially voiced as gai), to
							arrive at "a reason
							for living [being alive]; a meaning for [to] life; what [something that] makes life worth
							living; a raison
							d'être"</p>
